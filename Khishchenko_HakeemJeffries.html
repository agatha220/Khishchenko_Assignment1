			<h2>Potential Removal of Republicans from Committee Roles</h2>
			<p>
				Jeffries has taken a strong leadership role as the House Minority Leader. Recently, he has indicated that if the Democrates win the House, he will consider <a href=https://www.axios.com/2024/09/19/hakeem-jeffries-house-committees-intel/>removing Republicans</a> like Scott Perry and Ronny Jackson from the House Intelligence Committee. Speaker Mike Johnson had appointed both Perry and Jackson despite bipartisan disapproval.

	<section class="last">
		<h2>Communication as House Minority Leader</h2>
		<p>
			Jeffries is one of the best orators in Congress, although he has a tendency to lean on his talking points and evading direct questions. In a recent interview with <a href=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/hakeem-jeffries-mike-johnson-house-january-6/>Vanity Fair</a> when asked if Democrats would win back the House this fall, he gave a political answer about American people and freedom, and failed to answer the question directly. 
		</p>

		<p> That being said, his communication skils are one of the best and "have not gone unnoticed among his Democratic colleagues." Memphis Democrat Steve Cohen said "I don't think he knows what a teleprompter is."
